## 💻 How to Run

Make sure you have a C++ compiler like `g++` (MinGW for Windows) installed.

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o program
./program
📁 Folder Structure
Each project lives in its own folder with:

main.cpp or similar file

i made each one with different ides and code editors so they are different

Any resources used (txt files, images, etc.)

🎯 Why This Repo Exists
I built this repo to:

Practice and improve my C++ skills

Keep a public backup of my projects

Track my progress over time

Show what I’ve built as a student from Syria learning programming solo
